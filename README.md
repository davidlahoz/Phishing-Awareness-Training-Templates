# Phishing Awareness Training Templates

This repository offers customizable templates for phishing awareness training, including **email templates** and **landing pages**. These templates are designed to help organizations educate their employees on recognizing and reporting phishing threats in a safe, controlled environment.

> **Disclaimer**: These templates are for **educational and training purposes only**. They should be used exclusively within authorized training sessions.

## 📋 Features

- **Windows Defender Ready**: Templates are crafted to work and be used with the Attack Simulation tool from Microsoft Defender.
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Includes common phishing tactics like security alerts, login attempts, password resets, and shared file invitations.
- **Customizable Templates**: Adapt the text, links, and branding to suit your organization’s training needs.
- **Email and Landing Pages**: Each email template is complemented by a corresponding landing page to enhance the training experience.
